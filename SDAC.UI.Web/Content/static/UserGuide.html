	<h2> Introduction to the Student Data Aggregation Calculator</h2>
        <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
			<p>The Student Data Aggregation Calculator (SDAC) is intended for users who want to identify
                subsets of students across the inBloom Data Store.</p>

            <p>The Student Data Aggregation Calculator is a flexible and intuitive application that
                allows educators to create flags with specific conditions, and run those conditions across
                the student database to identify subsets of students who meet the criteria. The flags can
                be saved for future use, creating an easy-to-use tool that can quickly identify students.</p>
            
            <p>Users have permissions assigned to them based on their role (i.e. Educator, IT Administrator). 
                Some actions are only available to users with Administrator privileges. As an example, IT Administrators 
                are able to create public flags, where an Educator with default permissions will not have the required permissions. 
                This is an aspect to be aware of when creating, editing, or deleting public flags.</p>

            <p>For information about your current permission level, please contact your district administrator.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
   	<h4>Overview</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'> 
        <p>The Results page displays a list of students based on the criteria defined for the selected flag.
        The name of the flag and description are prominently displayed above the list of students.
        The information displayed in the table includes Student ID, 
        Student Name, Ethnicity, Gender, Grade Level and the field selected when the user created the flag.  
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Actions</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
    
        <p>Several additional options are available on the Results page including:</p>

<h2>Add/Edit Flag</h2>
    <h4> Overview</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
    
        <p>
        The Add/Edit page allows you to add or edit a flag using a visually engaging step-by-step approach.
        Prior to defining a flag, you must enter a Name and Description for the flag. 
        You may also enter optional Keywords to add further relevance for each flag and to better assist in the search of flags. 
        </p>
        <p>If you are logged on as a District Admin, the option to set a flag as Public will be made available.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4> Adding a New Flag</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>The process for adding a new flag is as follows:</p>
        
        <h5>Step 1: Select a Data Element</h5>
        <p>The user begins by typing the word that describes the name of the data element they are interesting in using. 
        This causes the list to begin filtering data elements so only the most relevant data elements appear in the list.  
        Once the user clicks on the data element it will appear highlighted and display in the Preview section indicating the field is now selected.
        The list of data elements is also sortable by Name or Description columns.  
        If the user chooses to do so, they may scroll through the list and select a data element.
        </p>


        <h5>Step 2: Apply a Condition</h5>
        <p>Depending on the data type of the data element selected, the application will automatically 
        disable operators in the list that are invalid for that data type.  For example, when a user selects 
        a numeric data type such as GPA, the Starts with, Does not start with, Ends with and Does not end with 
        operators will be grayed out.  This will enhance the user experience by eliminating invalid selections.
        </p>

        <p>The following operators are available for selection.  Only one operator may be selected at a time.</p>
        
        <table class="table table-bordered table-condensed">
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Is equal to </td><td>Starts with</td><td>Is between</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Is not equal to</td><td>Does not start with</td><td>Is not between</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Is greater than</td><td>Ends with</td><td>Is one of</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Is greater than or equal to </td><td>Does not end with</td><td>Is not one of</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Is less than</td><td>Contains</td><td>Is blank or empty</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Is less than or equal to</td><td>Does not contain</td><td>Is not blank nor empty</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

<!----- TESTING TESTING ----->


        <h5>Step 3: Set the Value</h5>
        <p>Enter a value in the textbox which will determine the output of the flag.</p>

        <p >The application will perform basic validation to ensure input values match the data type of the data element selected. 
        For example, if you select Enrollment Date, the textbox will become a date picker.  Another example, if you select Rank,
        the textbox will only allow numbers to be entered.
        </p>

        <h5>Step 4: Preview and Save</h5>
        <p>As you progress from Step 1 through Step 3, the Preview pane continually updates and displays the selected data element,
        operator and values entered.  This provides a visual representation of the flag definition before clicking the Save button.</p>

        <div class="buttons">
            <input class="btn_small" type="button" value="Preview" name="">
        </div>

        <p>Once the flag is defined, click the Preview button to executive the flag.
        The application will retrieve 5 records for you to view in the preview data grid. 
        This ensures you have set the flag as intended and will aid you from having to click Save and run the flag continually in a separate screen.
        </p>

        <div class="buttons">
            <input class="btn_small" type="button" value="Save" name="">
        </div>

        <p>You can continue modifying the flag and click Save once you are satisfied the flag has been defined correctly.</p>

        <p><i>Note 1: The Flag Name must be unique within your list of defined flags.  
        Public Flags must also be unique but only within the domain of Public Flags.</i></p>

        <p><i>Note 2: The Copy Flag feature is similar to the Edit Flag feature except in that you must define a new Name for the flag.</i></p>

<h2>Aggregate Flag</h2>
    <h4> Overview</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>An Aggregate Flag is the combination of multiple flags defined as either private 
        (created by you) or Public (created by an Admin user) and which allows you to perform 
        advanced analysis of student data.  By aggregating individual flags, you can identify 
        students with very specific qualities or factors.  As an example, you may wish to create 
        an Aggregate Flag called High Performing Underprivileged Students that consists of the 
        following flags:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Honor Roll</p></li>
            <li><p>Free and Reduced Lunch</p></li>
            <li><p>English Language Learner</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>The application will perform the necessary aggregation of each data set for the individual 
        flags resulting in the list of students that meet these collective criteria.  The results of 
        an Aggregate Flag only includes students that are inclusive of each individual flag.  Using 
        the example above, the High Performing Underprivileged Students flag will only list students 
        that appear in the Honor Roll AND Free and Reduced Lunch AND English Language Learner flags.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Adding a New Aggregate Flag</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
      
        <p>The steps required to create an Aggregate Flag are as follows.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><p>Enter a Name for the flag.</p></li>
            <li><p>Enter a Description for the flag.</p></li>
            <li><p>Enter optional Keywords to add further relevance for each flag and to better assist in the search of flags.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you are logged on as a District Admin, the option to set a flag as Public will be made available.</p> </li>
            <li><p>Select flags from the list using one of the following methods</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>Search:</strong> Search for flags based on the name, description or keyword defined for each flag. Once you begin typing in the search field, the list of flags will start to filter dynamically based on corresponding matches found using the letters or words you type.    </p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Drag and Drop:</strong> Select a flag from the list of flags and move it to the list on the right by clicking on the right arrow or by dragging and dropping the flag.</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <img src="img/save_help.png" alt="savehelp"><br>
        <p>Click Save once you are satisfied the Aggregate Flag has been defined correctly.</p>


        <p><i>Note: Check the Show Public Flags option to include flags that are defined as public in the search results.</i></p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Run the Aggregate Flag</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
    
        <p>Once an Aggregate Flag is saved, you may access and view the flag by using one of the following methods:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Select the flag from the My Flags drop down</p></li>
            <li><p>Locate flags on the Search page which have the following icon <img src="img/aggregate_list.png" alt="aggregate help"></p></li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>Note: This version of the SDAC limits the number of individual flags that can be added 
        to an Aggregate to five. When combining some flags, the application may prompt you that the 
        selected flags may not be combined due to the source of each flags data element. </i></p>

<h2>SDAC Tutorial on Creating and Using Flags</h2>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>
        <p>
            This is a brief tutorial to show a new user how to create and use flags with the Student Data Aggregation 
            Calculator (SDAC). To get to the SDAC application, simply enter <a href="http://dac.inbloom.org">dac.inbloom.org</a> 
            into a web browser. Next, the user will be prompted to enter their inBloom username and password.
        </p>

        <p>After a user logs in to inBloom, the user will be prompted to select a Data Set and virtual Sandbox User.</p>
   
        <img src="./img/Dataset_and_User.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>
        
        <br />

        <p>We recommend selecting the Small Data Set and one of the virtual Sanbox Users highlighted in the image above. 
            The users are also listed in the following table:
        </p>

        <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Role</th>
                    <th>Permission Level</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Charles Gray</td>
                    <td>Educator</td>
                    <td>Non-Administrator</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Linda Kim</td>
                    <td>Educator</td>
                    <td>Non-Administrator</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rebecca Braverman</td>

                <tr>
                    <td>Amy Kopal</td>
                    <td>IT Administrator</td>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <br />
        
        <p>
            The user should choose a virtual Sandbox User based on the level of privileges the user needs 
                while using the SDAC.
        </p>
   
        <p>
            Adminstrator permission levels give the user the ability to create, edit and delete public flags 
            in the SDAC. Public flags can be accessed by multiple users. Without adminstrator priviledges, 
            the user can create personal flags and save them for personal use; however, no other users will be able 
            to access these personal flags.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Creating a New Flag</h4>
    <div style='margin-left:.25in'>

        <p>
            After selecting the Data Set and Sandbox User, the user will be redirected to the SDAC home page.
        </p>

        <img src="./img/search_home.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>
        
        <br />

        <p>
            The SDAC home page will have the "Search" tab selected, as shown in the previous image.  In order for the 
            user to create their first flag, the user can click on the "New Flag" button.  This button is shown in the 
            previous image.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            After clicking on the "New Flag" button, the SDAC will change from the "Search" tab to the "Add/Edit" tab. 
        </p>

        <img src="./img/add_edit_name.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>
        
        <br />
    
        <p>
            To create a new flag, the user must enter a name and a description for the flag.  The location of the "Name" 
            and "Description" fields are shown in the previous image.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this example, the flag will take the following values:
        </p>

        <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Field</th>
                    <th>Value</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Name</td>
                    <td>GPA above 3.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Description</td>
                    <td>Lists students with grade point averages above 3.00</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Keyword</td>
                    <td>HonorRoll</td>

        <p>
            InBloom's Small Data Set, which was recommended as the data set to select, does not values entered for every 
            field in the inBloom API. Below is a list of the data fields that have values and are recommended for creation 
            of new flags.
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Grade point average (GPA)</li>
            <li>Student's name</li>
            <li>Home address</li>
            <li>Number of absences (between 0 and 2)</li>
            <li>Number of tardies (between 0 and 2)</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            For this example, the flag will take the following values:
        </p>
        
        <table class="table table-bordered table-hover table-condensed">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Field</th>
                    <th>Value</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Data Element</td>
                    <td>Student Academic Record</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Data Sub-Element</td>
                    <td>Cumulative Grade Point Average</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Condition</td>
                    <td>Is greater than</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Value</td>
                    <td>3.00</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <br />
    
        <p>
            The user will be sent to a Results page where all the students in the selected Data Set with a GPA above 3.00 
            will be listed.
        </p>
    
        <img src="./img/results_page.png" class="screenshot img-rounded"/>
        
        <br />
    
        <p>
            The Search page shows the flag name and description, along with the list of students that match the query. 
            There is a maximum of 10 students displayed on the page.  To see the next page of students, click on the 
            "Next" button in the bottom right corner of the Search page.
